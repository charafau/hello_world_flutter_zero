# Hello World Flutter Zero

A simple “Hello World” Flutter project based on **Flutter Zero** — a minimal Flutter runtime without built-in UI toolkits. This repository demonstrates how to create and run a basic Flutter application using the Flutter Zero setup from the **flutter_zero** project.

## 🧠 What is Flutter Zero?

**Flutter Zero** is a stripped-down version of the Flutter engine that deliberately omits the UI layer (no Skia, no Impeller, no `dart:ui`). It provides a lean Dart runtime compatible with Flutter tooling, enabling experimentation with custom UI layers or alternative renderers while still using the familiar Flutter toolchain.

This project builds on that concept and shows the simplest possible Flutter Zero app — a “Hello World.”
